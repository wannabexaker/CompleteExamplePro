# 🧠 CompleteExamplePro

**CompleteExamplePro** is a **fully featured, production-ready ASP.NET Core MVC solution** built with **Entity Framework Core** and **PostgreSQL**, packaged for instant deployment via **Docker**.  
It demonstrates professional full-stack architecture, modular data design, and end-to-end automation — ideal for learning, prototyping, or extending into real-world enterprise systems.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔹 Full MVC Architecture**  
  Structured separation of Controllers, Models, and Razor Views for clean, maintainable development.

- **🔹 Entity Framework Core 8 (Code-First)**  
  Implements code-first migrations, seeding, and advanced relational mapping across entities (Users, Events, Locations, Organizers, Cities, Tags).

- **🔹 PostgreSQL Integration**  
  Pre-configured for automatic database creation and initialization with `DbContext` and migrations.

- **🔹 Dockerized Environment**  
  Ships with ready-to-run `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` — launches both the web application and PostgreSQL database in isolated containers.

- **🔹 Automated Windows Scripts**  
  Includes `.bat` utilities for simplified control:  
  - `run_app.bat` – start containers  
  - `stop_app.bat` – stop and clean up  
  - `rebuild_app.bat` – rebuild and redeploy

- **🔹 Built-in Logging & Middleware**  
  Developer diagnostics, data-protection keys, HTTPS redirection, and structured request logging enabled by default.

- **🔹 Cross-Platform Ready**  
  Runs identically on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** with Docker Desktop.
